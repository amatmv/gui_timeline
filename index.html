                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <img src="img/vision/visionabout.gif">
                <p>VisiCorp Visi On was the first full featured desktop GUI for the IBM PC. Legend has it Bill
                Gates saw a demo of this running at the 1982 comdex running on an IBM PC. He freaked
                out because Microsoft didn't have anything like this yet, ran back to Microsoft
                Headquarters, and had them start work on what became Windows.</p>

                <p>The Visi On 1.0 files, interestingly, are dated December of 1983, the same month the
                "Microsoft Windows" article appeared in Byte Magazine. As we know Windows 1.0 was not
                released until 1985. If this was an attempt to keep people away from Visi On, it worked. In
                august 1984 VisiCorp sold Visi On to Control Data Corp, where it was apparently never
                heard from again.</p>
                <p>The Visi On product was apparently not intended for the home user. It was designed and
                priced for high end corporate workstations. The hardware it required was quite a bit for
                1983. It required a minimum of 512k of ram and a hard drive (5 megs of space).
                A very interesting feature of Visi On is the way it was designed. It was designed to be
                portable to other OSes such as CP/M or Unix, or to other CPUs besides the 8086. It did this
                by providing a kind of non machine specific "virtual machine" (called the Visi Machine) that
                all applications were written for. Only the very core of Visi On (called the Visi Host) was
                machine specific.</p>
                <p>Applications were developed in "Visi C", a fairly restricted subset of C designed for
                maximum portability. The development environment was Unix based and included a non-
                graphical version of the Visi-Host that let portions of Visi-On applications be run and tested

                on Unix.</p>

                <h2>Creation</h2>
                <p>In July 1981 Xerox announced the Xerox Star, an advanced workstation computer featuring
                a graphical user interface, and by that point it was a well known "secret" that Apple
                Computer was working on a low-cost computer with a GUI that would later be released as
                the Apple Lisa. Personal Software's president, Terry Opdendyk, knew of a two-man team
                in Texas that was working on a GUI, and arranged for Scott Warren and Dennis Abbe to
                visit Personal Software's headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. They demonstrated a
                version of the Smalltalk programming language running on the TRS-80 microcomputer, a
                seriously underpowered machine for the task. Personal Software was extremely impressed.
                A contract was soon signed, and work on project "Quasar" started almost immediately. The
                name was shortly thereafter changed to Visi On, a play on "vision" that retained their "Visi"
                naming. An experimental port to the ill-fated Apple III was completed in November, and
                after that, development work shifted to the DEC VAX, which had cross-compilers for a
                number of different machines. In early 1982 Personal Software changed their name
                to VisiCorp, and was betting much of the future success of the company on Visi On.
                Visi On had many features of a modern GUI, and included a few that did not become
                common until many years later. It was fully mouse-driven, used a bit-mapped display for
                both text and graphics, included on-line help, and allowed the user to open a number of
                programs at once, each in its own window. Visi On did not, however, include a graphical file
                manager. Visi On also demanded a hard drive in order to implement its virtual
                memory system used for "fast switching", and at the time hard drives were a very
                expensive piece of equipment.</p>
              </section>
              <section id="_sec-3" class="hidden">
                <h2>Reception</h2>
                <p>The main disadvantage of Visi On was its extremely high system requirements by 1982
standards. It needed 512 kilobytes of RAM and a hard disk at a time when PCs shipped
with 64k-128k and IBM did not yet offer a hard disk with the PC (IBM's first model with a
hard drive, the PC XT, didn't ship until March 1983). Third-party drives were however
available at the time, typically 5MB units that connected to the floppy controller and were
treated by the operating system as an oversized floppy disk (there was no subdirectory
support). This brought the total cost of running Visi On to $7500, three-quarters the cost of
the Apple Lisa.
The press continued to laud the product, going so far as to claim it represented the end of
operating systems. The end-users were less impressed, however, not only due to the high
cost of the required hardware, but also the general slowness of the system. In a market
where computers were generally used for only one or two tasks, usually business related,
the whole purpose of Visi On was seriously diluted.
In January 1984, Apple Computer released the Macintosh with much fanfare. Although the
Macintosh was seriously lacking software, it was faster, cheaper, and included one feature
Visi On lacked: a graphical file manager (the Finder). Although it didn't compete directly
with Visi On, which was really a "PC product", it nevertheless demonstrated that a GUI
could indeed be fast and relatively inexpensive, both of which Visi On failed to deliver.
Adding to the release's problems was Bill Gates, who took a page from VisiCorp's book and
announced that their own product, Microsoft Windows, would be available in May 1984.
This muddied the waters significantly, notably when he further claimed it would have a
similar feature set, didn't require a hard disk, and cost only $250. Ironically, Windows was
released with an even longer delay than Visi On, only shipping in November 1985, and was
lacking the features that forced Visi On to demand a hard drive.</p>

              <section id="_sec-4" class="hidden">
                <h2>Section 4</h2>
                <p>Only eight VisiCorp employees were still developing Visi On when VisiCorp sold the source
code to Control Data in mid-1984 to raise cash as it sued Software Arts, while continuing to
sell the software itself.Sales were apparently very slow; in February 1985, VisiCorp
responded by lowering the price of the basic OS to $99, knowing that anyone purchasing it
would also need to buy the applications. These were bundled, all three for $990. This
improved the situation somewhat, but sales were still far below projections, and it was
certainly not helping the company stave off the problems due to Lotus 1-2-3.
Following declining VisiCalc sales and low revenues from Visi On, in November, 1985 the
company merged with Paladin Software. The new company kept the Paladin name.
VisiCorp, and its line of "VisiProducts", were history.</p>

                <p>GEOS, released in 1985, is a full blown operating system and graphical user interface for
the Commodore 64 computer.
The Commodore 64 was an extremely popular home computer in the 1980s. It was
manufactured from 1982 to 1993, sold somewhere around 25 million units, and for a time it
was the best selling computer in the world.
Primarily designed as a video game console, the Commodore 64 uses a 6510 processor
and has 64 KB of RAM. Many optional peripherals were made for it including a disk drive,
joysticks, and (although less common) even mice. A huge amount of software has been
written for it including both games and productivity applications.</p>

                <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>Written by a group of programmers, the GEOS Design Team: Jim DeFrisco, Dave Durran,
Michael Farr, Doug Fults, Chris Hawley, Clayton Jung, and Tony Requist, led by
Dougherty, who cut their teeth on limited-resource video game machines such as the Atari
2600, GEOS was revered for what it could accomplish on machines with 64–
128 kB of RAM memory and 1–2 MHz of 8-bit processing power.
Unlike many pieces of proprietary software for the C64 and C128, GEOS takes full
advantage of many of the add-ons and improvements available for these systems.
Commodore's 1351 mouse is supported by GEOS, as are its various RAM expansion units.
GEOS 128 also fully supports the C128's 640×200 high-resolution VDC display mode
through a compatible RGB monitor.
The C64 version of GEOS incorporates a built-in fast loader, called diskTurbo, that
significantly increases the speed of drive access on the slow 1541. GEOS is the first
Commodore software that could use a floppy disk as swap space or virtual memory. GEOS
128 can take advantage of the C128's enhanced "burst mode" in conjunction with
the 1571 and 1581 drives. The Commodore version of GEOS uses a copy
protection scheme that renders users' disks unbootable if it detects that the disk has been
illegally duplicated.
Via Berkeley's special geoCable interface converter or other third-party interfaces to
connect standard RS-232 or Centronics printers to the Commodore serial bus, GEOS
supports a wide variety of printers, including HP PCL printers and the Apple LaserWriter.
This ability to print to high-end printers was a major factor in making GEOS a desktop
publishing platform.
The Apple II version of GEOS was released as freeware in August 2003. The Commodore
64/128 versions followed in February 2004. The Apple II version is freely available for
download from Breadbox.
The latest GEOS desktop suite for IBM PC compatibles is Breadbox Ensemble. Revivals
were seen in the OmniGo handhelds, Brother GeoBook line of laptop-appliances, andthe NewDeal Office package for PCs. Related code found its way to earlier "Zoomer"
PDAs, creating an unclear lineage to Palm, Inc.'s later work. Nokia used GEOS as a base
operating system for their Nokia Communicator series, before switching
to EPOC (Symbian).</p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <img src="img/gem/PCrunningGBEM.jpg">
                <p>Graphics Environment Manager (GEM) was an operating environment created by Digital
Research (DRI) for use with the DOS operating system on Intel 8088 and Motorola
68000 microprocessors.
GEM is known primarily as the graphical user interface (GUI) for the Atari ST series of
computers, and was also supplied with a series of IBM PC-compatible computers
from Amstrad. It also was available for standard IBM PC, at the time when the 6 MHz IBM
PC AT (and the very concept of a GUI) was brand new. It was the core for a small number
of DOS programs, the most notable being Ventura Publisher. It was ported to a number of
other computers that previously lacked graphical interfaces, but never gained popularity on
those platforms. DRI also produced X/GEM for their FlexOS real-time operating
system with adaptations for OS/2 Presentation Manager and the X Window System under
preparation as well.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <h3>GSX</h3>
                <p>GEM started life at DRI as a more general purpose graphics library known as GSX
(Graphics System Extension), written by a team led by Don Heiskell. Lee Lorenzen(at
Graphic Software Systems, Inc.) who had recently left Xerox PARC (birthplace of the GUI)
wrote much of the code. GSX was essentially a DRI-specific implementation of
the GKS graphics standard proposed in the late 1970s. GSX was intended to allow DRI to
write graphics programs (charting, etc.) for any of the platforms CP/M-80, CP/M-
86 and MS-DOS (NEC APC-III) would run on, a task that would otherwise require
considerable effort to port due to the large differences in graphics hardware (and concepts)
between the various systems of that era.
GSX consisted of two parts: a selection of routines for common drawing operations, and
the device drivers that are responsible for handling the actual output. The former was
known as GDOS and the latter as GIOS, a play on the division of CP/M into machine-
independent BDOS and machine-specific BIOS. GDOS was a selection of routines that
handled the GKS drawing, while GIOS actually used the underlying hardware to produce
the output.</p>
                <h3>GEM</h3>
                <p>GSX evolved into one part of what would later be known as GEM, which was an effort to
build a fully GUI system using the earlier GSX work as its basis. Originally known
as Crystal as a play on an IBM project called Glass, the name was later changed to GEM.
Under GEM, GSX became GEM VDI (Virtual Device Interface), responsible for basic
graphics and drawing. VDI also added the ability to work with multiple fonts and added a
selection of raster drawing commands to the formerly vector-only GKS-based drawing
commands. VDI also added multiple viewports, a key addition for use with windows.
A new module, GEM AES (Application Environment Services), provided the window
management and UI elements, and GEM Desktop used both libraries in combination to
provide a GUI. The 8086 version of the entire system was first demoed at the
1984 COMDEX, and shipped as GEM/1 on 28 February 1985.</p>

                <h2>Versions</h2>
                <h3>GEM/1</h3>
                <img src="img/gem/Gem_1_Desktop.png">
                <p>GEM Desktop 1.0 was released on 28 February 1985. GEM Desktop 1.1 was released in
April, 1985, with support for CGA and EGA displays.A version for the Apricot Computers F-
Series, supporting 640×200 in up to 8 colors was also available as GEM Desktop 1.2.
DRI originally designed GEM for DOS so that it would check for and only run on IBM
computers, and not PC compatibles like those from Compaq, as the company hoped to
receive license fees from compatible makers. Developers reacted with
what BYTE described as "a small explosion"; it reported that at a DRI-hosted seminar in
February 1985, more than half of the attendees agreed that GEM's incompatibility with
Compaq was a serious limitation. Later that month the company removed the
restriction.Applications that supported GEM included Lifetree Software's GEM Write.
At this point, Apple Computer sued DRI in what would turn into a long dispute over the
"look and feel" of the GEM/1 system, which was an almost direct copy of Macintosh (with
some elements bearing a closer resemblance to those in the earlier Lisa, available since
January 1983). This eventually led to DRI being forced to change several basic features of
the system. (See also: Apple v. Digital Research.) Apple would later go on to sue other
companies for similar issues, including their copyright lawsuit against Microsoft and HP.
In addition to printers the system also contained drivers for some more unusual devices
such as the Polaroid Palette.</p>
                <h3>GEM/2</h3>
                <p>DRI responded with the "lawsuit friendly" GEM Desktop 2.0, released in March 1986, with
support for VGA displays. It allowed the display of only two fixed windows on the "desktop"
(other programs could do what they wished however), changed the trash can icon, and
removed the animations for things like opening and closing windows. It was otherwise
similar to GEM/1, but also included a number of bug fixes and cosmetic improvements.</p>
                <h3>GEM/3</h3>
                <p>The last commercial release was GEM/3 Desktop, released in November 1988, which had
speed improvements and shipped with a number of basic applications. Commercial sales of
GEM ended with GEM/3; the source code was subsequently made available to a number of
DRI's leading customers.</p>
                <h3>GEM/4</h3>
                <p>GEM/4, released in 1990, included the ability to work with Bézier curves, a feature still not
common outside the PostScript world. This version was produced specifically for Artline, a
drawing program from the German company CCP Development GmbH. The system also
included changes to the font management system, which made it incompatible with the
likes of Timeworks Publisher.
Another version of GEM called GEM/5, released in 1988, was produced
by GST for Timeworks Publisher 2.1. It contained an updated look with 3D buttons. Font
scaling on the fly was included. It came complete with all the standard 3.1 tools. This
version was produced from GEM 3.13 with only the Bézier handling taken from GEM/4.</p>
                <h3>ViewMax</h3>
                <p>GEM Desktop itself was spun off in 1990 as a product known as ViewMAX which was used
solely as a file management shell under DR-DOS. In this form the system could not run
other GEM programs. This led to a situation where a number of applications (including
ViewMAX) could exist all with their own statically linked copy of the GEM system. This
scenario was actually rare, as few native GEM programs were published. In 1991
ViewMAX/2 was is released.
In these forms GEM survived until DRI was purchased by Novell and all GEM development
was cancelled.</p>
                <h3>Multitasking GEM</h3>
                <p>Throughout this time DRI had also been working on making the GEM system capable of
multitasking. This started with X/GEM based on GEM/1, but this required use of one of the
multitasking CP/M based operating systems. GEM/XM was an updated version of GEM/2
which allowed multitasking and the ability to run DOS programs in shell windows (as
Windows does today). None of these saw the light of day, but the GEM/XM source code is
now freely available under the terms of GNU General Public License.</p>
                <h3>Ventura</h3>
                <p>Lee Lorenzen left soon after the release of GEM/1, when it became clear that DRI had no
strong interest in applications development. He then joined with two other former DRI
employees, Don Heiskell and John Meyer, to start Ventura Software. They
developed Ventura Publisher (which was later marketed by Xerox and eventually by Corel),
which would go on to be a very popular desktop publishing program for some time.</p>
                <h3>Atari Versions</h3>
                <p>Development of the production 68000 version of GEM began in September 1984, when
Atari sent a team called "The Monterey Group" to Digital Research to begin work on porting
GEM. Originally the plan was to run GEM on top of CP/M-68K, both ostensibly ported
to Motorola 68000 by DRI prior to the ST design being created. In fact, these ports were
unusable and would require considerable development. Atari eventually decided to give up
on the existing code and port GEMDOS, a DOS-like operating system that DRI had
experimented with instead, referring to it as TOS.
As Atari had provided most of the development of the 68k version, they were given full
rights to continued developments without needing to reverse-license it back to DRI, who
had apparently lost interest in the 68000 platform. As a result, the Apple-DRI lawsuit did not
apply to the Atari versions of GEM, and they were allowed to keep a more Mac-like UI.
Over the next seven years, from 1985 to 1992, new versions of TOS were released with
each new generation of the ST line. Updates included support for more colors and higher
resolutions in the raster-side of the system, but remained generally similar to the original in
terms of GKS support. In 1992 Atari released TOS 4, or MultiTOS, along with their final
computer system, the Falcon030. In combination with MiNT, TOS 4 allowed full
multitasking support in GEM</p>
