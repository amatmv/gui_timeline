                <p>VisiCorp Visi On was the first full featured desktop GUI for the IBM PC. Legend has it Bill
                Gates saw a demo of this running at the 1982 comdex running on an IBM PC. He freaked
                out because Microsoft didn't have anything like this yet, ran back to Microsoft
                Headquarters, and had them start work on what became Windows.</p>

                <p>The Visi On 1.0 files, interestingly, are dated December of 1983, the same month the
                "Microsoft Windows" article appeared in Byte Magazine. As we know Windows 1.0 was not
                released until 1985. If this was an attempt to keep people away from Visi On, it worked. In
                august 1984 VisiCorp sold Visi On to Control Data Corp, where it was apparently never
                heard from again.</p>
                <p>The Visi On product was apparently not intended for the home user. It was designed and
                priced for high end corporate workstations. The hardware it required was quite a bit for
                1983. It required a minimum of 512k of ram and a hard drive (5 megs of space).
                A very interesting feature of Visi On is the way it was designed. It was designed to be
                portable to other OSes such as CP/M or Unix, or to other CPUs besides the 8086. It did this
                by providing a kind of non machine specific "virtual machine" (called the Visi Machine) that
                all applications were written for. Only the very core of Visi On (called the Visi Host) was
                machine specific.</p>
                <p>Applications were developed in "Visi C", a fairly restricted subset of C designed for
                maximum portability. The development environment was Unix based and included a non-
                graphical version of the Visi-Host that let portions of Visi-On applications be run and tested

                on Unix.</p>

                <h2>Creation</h2>
                <p>In July 1981 Xerox announced the Xerox Star, an advanced workstation computer featuring
                a graphical user interface, and by that point it was a well known "secret" that Apple
                Computer was working on a low-cost computer with a GUI that would later be released as
                the Apple Lisa. Personal Software's president, Terry Opdendyk, knew of a two-man team
                in Texas that was working on a GUI, and arranged for Scott Warren and Dennis Abbe to
                visit Personal Software's headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. They demonstrated a
                version of the Smalltalk programming language running on the TRS-80 microcomputer, a
                seriously underpowered machine for the task. Personal Software was extremely impressed.
                A contract was soon signed, and work on project "Quasar" started almost immediately. The
                name was shortly thereafter changed to Visi On, a play on "vision" that retained their "Visi"
                naming. An experimental port to the ill-fated Apple III was completed in November, and
                after that, development work shifted to the DEC VAX, which had cross-compilers for a
                number of different machines. In early 1982 Personal Software changed their name
                to VisiCorp, and was betting much of the future success of the company on Visi On.
                Visi On had many features of a modern GUI, and included a few that did not become
                common until many years later. It was fully mouse-driven, used a bit-mapped display for
                both text and graphics, included on-line help, and allowed the user to open a number of
                programs at once, each in its own window. Visi On did not, however, include a graphical file
                manager. Visi On also demanded a hard drive in order to implement its virtual
                memory system used for "fast switching", and at the time hard drives were a very
                expensive piece of equipment.</p>
              </section>
              <section id="_sec-3" class="hidden">
                <h2>Reception</h2>
                <p>The main disadvantage of Visi On was its extremely high system requirements by 1982
standards. It needed 512 kilobytes of RAM and a hard disk at a time when PCs shipped
with 64k-128k and IBM did not yet offer a hard disk with the PC (IBM's first model with a
hard drive, the PC XT, didn't ship until March 1983). Third-party drives were however
available at the time, typically 5MB units that connected to the floppy controller and were
treated by the operating system as an oversized floppy disk (there was no subdirectory
support). This brought the total cost of running Visi On to $7500, three-quarters the cost of
the Apple Lisa.
The press continued to laud the product, going so far as to claim it represented the end of
operating systems. The end-users were less impressed, however, not only due to the high
cost of the required hardware, but also the general slowness of the system. In a market
where computers were generally used for only one or two tasks, usually business related,
the whole purpose of Visi On was seriously diluted.
In January 1984, Apple Computer released the Macintosh with much fanfare. Although the
Macintosh was seriously lacking software, it was faster, cheaper, and included one feature
Visi On lacked: a graphical file manager (the Finder). Although it didn't compete directly
with Visi On, which was really a "PC product", it nevertheless demonstrated that a GUI
could indeed be fast and relatively inexpensive, both of which Visi On failed to deliver.
Adding to the release's problems was Bill Gates, who took a page from VisiCorp's book and
announced that their own product, Microsoft Windows, would be available in May 1984.
This muddied the waters significantly, notably when he further claimed it would have a
similar feature set, didn't require a hard disk, and cost only $250. Ironically, Windows was
released with an even longer delay than Visi On, only shipping in November 1985, and was
lacking the features that forced Visi On to demand a hard drive.</p>

              <section id="_sec-4" class="hidden">
                <h2>End of life</h2>
                <p>Only eight VisiCorp employees were still developing Visi On when VisiCorp sold the source
code to Control Data in mid-1984 to raise cash as it sued Software Arts, while continuing to
sell the software itself.Sales were apparently very slow; in February 1985, VisiCorp
responded by lowering the price of the basic OS to $99, knowing that anyone purchasing it
would also need to buy the applications. These were bundled, all three for $990. This
improved the situation somewhat, but sales were still far below projections, and it was
certainly not helping the company stave off the problems due to Lotus 1-2-3.
Following declining VisiCalc sales and low revenues from Visi On, in November, 1985 the
company merged with Paladin Software. The new company kept the Paladin name.
VisiCorp, and its line of "VisiProducts", were history.</p>

                <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>Written by a group of programmers, the GEOS Design Team: Jim DeFrisco, Dave Durran,
Michael Farr, Doug Fults, Chris Hawley, Clayton Jung, and Tony Requist, led by
Dougherty, who cut their teeth on limited-resource video game machines such as the Atari
2600, GEOS was revered for what it could accomplish on machines with 64–
128 kB of RAM memory and 1–2 MHz of 8-bit processing power.
Unlike many pieces of proprietary software for the C64 and C128, GEOS takes full
advantage of many of the add-ons and improvements available for these systems.
Commodore's 1351 mouse is supported by GEOS, as are its various RAM expansion units.
GEOS 128 also fully supports the C128's 640×200 high-resolution VDC display mode
through a compatible RGB monitor.
The C64 version of GEOS incorporates a built-in fast loader, called diskTurbo, that
significantly increases the speed of drive access on the slow 1541. GEOS is the first
Commodore software that could use a floppy disk as swap space or virtual memory. GEOS
128 can take advantage of the C128's enhanced "burst mode" in conjunction with
the 1571 and 1581 drives. The Commodore version of GEOS uses a copy
protection scheme that renders users' disks unbootable if it detects that the disk has been
illegally duplicated.
Via Berkeley's special geoCable interface converter or other third-party interfaces to
connect standard RS-232 or Centronics printers to the Commodore serial bus, GEOS
supports a wide variety of printers, including HP PCL printers and the Apple LaserWriter.
This ability to print to high-end printers was a major factor in making GEOS a desktop
publishing platform.
The Apple II version of GEOS was released as freeware in August 2003. The Commodore
64/128 versions followed in February 2004. The Apple II version is freely available for
download from Breadbox.
The latest GEOS desktop suite for IBM PC compatibles is Breadbox Ensemble. Revivals
were seen in the OmniGo handhelds, Brother GeoBook line of laptop-appliances, andthe NewDeal Office package for PCs. Related code found its way to earlier "Zoomer"
PDAs, creating an unclear lineage to Palm, Inc.'s later work. Nokia used GEOS as a base
operating system for their Nokia Communicator series, before switching
to EPOC (Symbian).</p>

                <p>Graphics Environment Manager (GEM) was an operating environment created by Digital
Research (DRI) for use with the DOS operating system on Intel 8088 and Motorola
68000 microprocessors.
GEM is known primarily as the graphical user interface (GUI) for the Atari ST series of
computers, and was also supplied with a series of IBM PC-compatible computers
from Amstrad. It also was available for standard IBM PC, at the time when the 6 MHz IBM
PC AT (and the very concept of a GUI) was brand new. It was the core for a small number
of DOS programs, the most notable being Ventura Publisher. It was ported to a number of
other computers that previously lacked graphical interfaces, but never gained popularity on
those platforms. DRI also produced X/GEM for their FlexOS real-time operating
system with adaptations for OS/2 Presentation Manager and the X Window System under
preparation as well.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <h3>GSX</h3>
                <p>GEM started life at DRI as a more general purpose graphics library known as GSX
(Graphics System Extension), written by a team led by Don Heiskell. Lee Lorenzen(at
Graphic Software Systems, Inc.) who had recently left Xerox PARC (birthplace of the GUI)
wrote much of the code. GSX was essentially a DRI-specific implementation of
the GKS graphics standard proposed in the late 1970s. GSX was intended to allow DRI to
write graphics programs (charting, etc.) for any of the platforms CP/M-80, CP/M-
86 and MS-DOS (NEC APC-III) would run on, a task that would otherwise require
considerable effort to port due to the large differences in graphics hardware (and concepts)
between the various systems of that era.
GSX consisted of two parts: a selection of routines for common drawing operations, and
the device drivers that are responsible for handling the actual output. The former was
known as GDOS and the latter as GIOS, a play on the division of CP/M into machine-
independent BDOS and machine-specific BIOS. GDOS was a selection of routines that
handled the GKS drawing, while GIOS actually used the underlying hardware to produce
the output.</p>
                <h3>GEM</h3>
                <p>GSX evolved into one part of what would later be known as GEM, which was an effort to
build a fully GUI system using the earlier GSX work as its basis. Originally known
as Crystal as a play on an IBM project called Glass, the name was later changed to GEM.
Under GEM, GSX became GEM VDI (Virtual Device Interface), responsible for basic
graphics and drawing. VDI also added the ability to work with multiple fonts and added a
selection of raster drawing commands to the formerly vector-only GKS-based drawing
commands. VDI also added multiple viewports, a key addition for use with windows.
A new module, GEM AES (Application Environment Services), provided the window
management and UI elements, and GEM Desktop used both libraries in combination to
provide a GUI. The 8086 version of the entire system was first demoed at the
1984 COMDEX, and shipped as GEM/1 on 28 February 1985.</p>

                <h2>Versions</h2>
                <h3>GEM/1</h3>
                <img src="img/gem/Gem_1_Desktop.png">
                <p>GEM Desktop 1.0 was released on 28 February 1985. GEM Desktop 1.1 was released in
April, 1985, with support for CGA and EGA displays.A version for the Apricot Computers F-
Series, supporting 640×200 in up to 8 colors was also available as GEM Desktop 1.2.
DRI originally designed GEM for DOS so that it would check for and only run on IBM
computers, and not PC compatibles like those from Compaq, as the company hoped to
receive license fees from compatible makers. Developers reacted with
what BYTE described as "a small explosion"; it reported that at a DRI-hosted seminar in
February 1985, more than half of the attendees agreed that GEM's incompatibility with
Compaq was a serious limitation. Later that month the company removed the
restriction.Applications that supported GEM included Lifetree Software's GEM Write.
At this point, Apple Computer sued DRI in what would turn into a long dispute over the
"look and feel" of the GEM/1 system, which was an almost direct copy of Macintosh (with
some elements bearing a closer resemblance to those in the earlier Lisa, available since
January 1983). This eventually led to DRI being forced to change several basic features of
the system. (See also: Apple v. Digital Research.) Apple would later go on to sue other
companies for similar issues, including their copyright lawsuit against Microsoft and HP.
In addition to printers the system also contained drivers for some more unusual devices
such as the Polaroid Palette.</p>
                <h3>GEM/2</h3>
                <img src="img/gem/Gem2desktop.png">
                <p>DRI responded with the "lawsuit friendly" GEM Desktop 2.0, released in March 1986, with
support for VGA displays. It allowed the display of only two fixed windows on the "desktop"
(other programs could do what they wished however), changed the trash can icon, and
removed the animations for things like opening and closing windows. It was otherwise
similar to GEM/1, but also included a number of bug fixes and cosmetic improvements.</p>
                <h3>GEM/3</h3>
                <img src="img/gem/gem3BOX.png">
                <p>The last commercial release was GEM/3 Desktop, released in November 1988, which had
speed improvements and shipped with a number of basic applications. Commercial sales of
GEM ended with GEM/3; the source code was subsequently made available to a number of
DRI's leading customers.</p>
                <img src="img/gem/gem3desk.png">
                <img src="img/gem/gem3outputApplication.png">
                <img src="img/gem/gem3preferences.png">
                <h3>GEM/4</h3>
                <p>GEM/4, released in 1990, included the ability to work with Bézier curves, a feature still not
common outside the PostScript world. This version was produced specifically for Artline, a
drawing program from the German company CCP Development GmbH. The system also
included changes to the font management system, which made it incompatible with the
likes of Timeworks Publisher.
Another version of GEM called GEM/5, released in 1988, was produced
by GST for Timeworks Publisher 2.1. It contained an updated look with 3D buttons. Font
scaling on the fly was included. It came complete with all the standard 3.1 tools. This
version was produced from GEM 3.13 with only the Bézier handling taken from GEM/4.</p>
                <h3>ViewMax</h3>
                <p>GEM Desktop itself was spun off in 1990 as a product known as ViewMAX which was used
solely as a file management shell under DR-DOS. In this form the system could not run
other GEM programs. This led to a situation where a number of applications (including
ViewMAX) could exist all with their own statically linked copy of the GEM system. This
scenario was actually rare, as few native GEM programs were published. In 1991
ViewMAX/2 was is released.
In these forms GEM survived until DRI was purchased by Novell and all GEM development
was cancelled.</p>
                <h3>Multitasking GEM</h3>
                <p>Throughout this time DRI had also been working on making the GEM system capable of
multitasking. This started with X/GEM based on GEM/1, but this required use of one of the
multitasking CP/M based operating systems. GEM/XM was an updated version of GEM/2
which allowed multitasking and the ability to run DOS programs in shell windows (as
Windows does today). None of these saw the light of day, but the GEM/XM source code is
now freely available under the terms of GNU General Public License.</p>
                <h3>Ventura</h3>
                <p>Lee Lorenzen left soon after the release of GEM/1, when it became clear that DRI had no
strong interest in applications development. He then joined with two other former DRI
employees, Don Heiskell and John Meyer, to start Ventura Software. They
developed Ventura Publisher (which was later marketed by Xerox and eventually by Corel),
which would go on to be a very popular desktop publishing program for some time.</p>
                <h3>Atari Versions</h3>
                <img src="img/gem/AtariVersion.png">
                <p>Development of the production 68000 version of GEM began in September 1984, when
Atari sent a team called "The Monterey Group" to Digital Research to begin work on porting
GEM. Originally the plan was to run GEM on top of CP/M-68K, both ostensibly ported
to Motorola 68000 by DRI prior to the ST design being created. In fact, these ports were
unusable and would require considerable development. Atari eventually decided to give up
on the existing code and port GEMDOS, a DOS-like operating system that DRI had
experimented with instead, referring to it as TOS.
As Atari had provided most of the development of the 68k version, they were given full
rights to continued developments without needing to reverse-license it back to DRI, who
had apparently lost interest in the 68000 platform. As a result, the Apple-DRI lawsuit did not
apply to the Atari versions of GEM, and they were allowed to keep a more Mac-like UI.
Over the next seven years, from 1985 to 1992, new versions of TOS were released with
each new generation of the ST line. Updates included support for more colors and higher
resolutions in the raster-side of the system, but remained generally similar to the original in
terms of GKS support. In 1992 Atari released TOS 4, or MultiTOS, along with their final
computer system, the Falcon030. In combination with MiNT, TOS 4 allowed full
multitasking support in GEM</p>

                <p>The "Classic" Mac OS is a graphical user interface-based operating system developed
by Apple Inc. for its Macintosh family of personal computers from 1984 until 2001, the
original member of the series of Macintosh operating systems. The Macintosh platform,
which was introduced in the classic Mac OS, is credited with having popularized the
early GUI concept. Mac OS was preinstalled on every Macintosh computer that was made
during the era it was developed; it was also sold separately in retail stores.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Apple released the original Macintosh on January 24, 1984. Its early system software was
partially based on the Lisa OS, previously released by Apple for the Lisa computer in 1983;
as part of an agreement allowing Xerox to buy shares in Apple at a favorable price, it also
used concepts from the Xerox PARCAlto computer, which former Apple CEO Steve
Jobs and other Macintosh team members had previewed. The operating system integral to
the Macintosh was originally named System Software, or simply "System", and referred to
by its major revision starting with System 6 and System 7. Apple rebranded the system
as Mac OS in 1996, starting officially with version 7.6, due in part to its Macintosh
clone program. That program ended after the release of Mac OS 8 in 1997. The last major
release of the system was Mac OS 9 in 1999.
Mac OS is characterized by its monolithic system. From its original release through System
4, it ran only one application at a time. Even so, it was noted for its ease of use. Mac OS
gained cooperative multitasking with System 5, which ran on the Macintosh
SE and Macintosh II. It was criticized for its very limited memory management, lack
of protected memory, no access controls, and susceptibility to conflicts
among extensions that provide additional functionality such as networking or support for a
particular device.
After a four-year development effort spearheaded by Steve Jobs' return to Apple in 1997,
Apple replaced Mac OS with a new operating system in 2001 named Mac OS X; the "X"
represented the tenth major revision of the Mac system software as well as its history as
part of NeXT and its relation to Unix. Mac OS X was renamed "OS X" in 2012 and "macOS"
in 2016. The general interface design of the current macOS shares its legacy with the
classic Mac OS, and there was some overlap of application frameworks for compatibility,
but the two systems have different origins and use deeply different architectures.
The final updates to Mac OS 9 released in 2001 provided interoperability with Mac OS X.
The name "Classic" that now signifies the historical Mac OS as a whole is a reference to
the Classic Environment, a compatibility layer that helped ease the transition to Mac OS X.</p>

              <section id="_sec-12" class="hidden">
                <h2>Architecture</h2>
                <h3>Compatibility</h3>
                <p>Early versions of Mac OS are compatible only with Motorola 68000-family Macintoshes. As
Apple introduced computers with PowerPC hardware, the OS was ported to support this
architecture. Mac OS 8.1 is the last version that could run on a "68K" processor
(the 68040).
In systems prior to PowerPC G3-based systems, significant parts of the system are stored
in physical ROM on the motherboard. The initial purpose of this is to avoid using up the
limited storage of floppy diskson system support, given that the early Macs have no hard
disk (only one model of Mac was ever actually bootable using the ROM alone, the
1991 Mac Classic model). This architecture also allows for a completely graphical OS
interface at the lowest level without the need for a text-only console or command-line
mode: boot time errors, such as finding no functioning disk drives, are communicated to the
user graphically, usually with an icon or the distinctive Chicago bitmap font and a Chime of
Death or a series of beeps. This is in contrast to MS-DOS and CP/M computers of the time,
which display such messages in a mono-spaced font on a black background, and require
the use of the keyboard rather than a mouse, for input. To provide such niceties at a low
level, early Mac OS depends on core system software in ROM on the motherboard, which
also ensure that only Apple computers or licensed clones (with the copyright-protected
ROMs from Apple) can run Mac OS.</p>
                <h3>File systems</h3>
                <p>The Macintosh originally used the Macintosh File System (MFS), a flat file system with only
one level of folders. This was quickly replaced in 1985 by the Hierarchical File
System (HFS), which had a true directory tree. Both file systems are otherwise compatible.
An improved file system named HFS Plus ("HFS+" or "Mac OS Extended") was announced
in 1997 and implemented in 1998.
Files in most file systems used with DOS, Windows, Unix, or other operating systems have
only one "fork". By contrast, MFS and HFS give files two different "forks". The data fork
contains the same sort of information as a file in other file systems, such as the text of a
document or the bitmaps of an image file. The resource fork contains other structured data
such as menu definitions, graphics, sounds, or code segments that would be incorporated
into a program's file format on other systems. An executable file might consist only of
resources (including code segments) with an empty data fork, while a data file might have
only a data fork with no resource fork. A word processor file could contain its text in the
data fork and styling information in the resource fork, so that an application which doesn’t
recognize the styling information can still read the raw text.
On the other hand, these forks would provide a challenge to interoperability with other
operating systems. In copying or transferring a Mac OS file to a non-Mac system, the
default implementations would simply strip the file of its resource fork. Most data
files contained only nonessential information in their resource fork, such as window size
and location, but program files would be inoperative without their resources. This
necessitated such encoding schemes as BinHex and MacBinary, which allowed a user to
encode a dual-forked file into a single stream, or inversely take a single stream so-encoded
and reconstitute it into a dual-forked file usable by Mac OS.</p>

GNOME is developed by The GNOME Project, part of the GNU Project.The GNOME Project is composed of both volunteers and paid contributors, the largest corporate contributor being Red Hat.

                <h2>HIstory</h2>
                <p>GNOME was started on August 15 1997 by Miguel de Icaza and Federico Menaas a free
software project to develop a desktop environment and applications for it. It was founded in
part because K Desktop Environment, which was growing in popularity, relied on
the Qt widget toolkit which used a proprietary software license until version 2.0 (June
1999). In place of Qt, the GTK+ toolkit was chosen as the base of GNOME. GTK+ uses
the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), a free software license that allows
software linking to it to use a much wider set of licenses, including proprietary software
licenses. GNOME itself is licensed under the LGPL for its libraries, and the GNU General
Public License (GPL) for its applications.
The name "GNOME" was initially an acronym of GNU Network Object Model Environment,
referring to the original intention of creating a distributed object framework similar
to Microsoft's OLE, but the acronym was eventually dropped because it no longer reflected
the vision of the GNOME project.
The California startup Eazel developed the Nautilus file manager from 1999 to 2001. De
Icaza and Nat Friedman founded Helix Code (later Ximian) in 1999 in Massachusetts; this
company developed GNOME's infrastructure and applications, and in 2003 was purchased
by Novell.
During the transition to GNOME 2 around the year 2001 and shortly thereafter there were
brief talks about creating a GNOME Office suite. On September 15, 2003 GNOME-Office
1.0, consisting of AbiWord 2.0, GNOME-DB 1.0 and Gnumeric 1.2.0 was
released. Although some release planning for GNOME Office 1.2 was happening on
gnome-office mailing list, and Gnumeric 1.4 was announced as a part of it, the 1.2 release
of the suite itself never materialized. As of May 4, 2014, GNOME wiki only mentions
"GNOME/Gtk applications that are useful in an office environment".</p>

                <img src="img/gnome/GNOME_INTERFACE.png">
                <p>GNOME Shell is the official user interface of the GNOME desktop environment. It features
a top bar holding (from left to right) an Activities button, an application menu, a clock and
an integrated system status menu. The application menu displays the name of the
application in focus and provides access to functions such as accessing the application's
preferences, closing the application, or creating a new application window. The status
menu holds various system status indicators, shortcuts to system settings, and session
actions including logging out, switching users, locking the screen, and suspending the
computer.
Clicking on the Activities button, moving the mouse to the top-left hot corner or pressing
the Super key brings up the Overview. The Overview gives users an overview of current
activities and provides a way to switch between windows and workspaces and to launch
applications. The Dash on the left houses shortcuts to favorite applications and open
windows and an application picker button to show a list of all installed applications. A
search bar appears at the top and a workspace list for switching between workspaces is on
the right. Notifications appear from the bottom of the screen.</p>

                <h2>Applications</h2>
                <h3>Core Applications</h3>
                <p>There are a large number of GTK+- and Clutter-based programs written by various authors.
Since the release of GNOME 3.0, The GNOME Project concentrates on developing a set of
programs that accounts for the GNOME Core Applications. The commonalities of the
GNOME Core Applications are the adherence to the current GNOME HUD guidelines as
well as the tight integration with underlying GNOME layers like e.g. GVfs and also with one
another e.g. GOA (gnome-online-accounts) settings and GNOME Files with Google
Drive and GNOME Photos with Google Photos. Some programs are simply renamed
existing programs with a revamped user interface, while others have been written from
scratch.</p>
                <h3>Games</h3>
                <p>GNOME Games have the look and feel of the GNOME Core Applications and are released
simultaneously with GNOME. All have been rewritten conforming to the current GNOME
Human Interface Guidelines.</p>
                <h3>Development Tools</h3>
                <p>Programmers have written software to provide development tools consistent with the
GNOME desktop and to facilitate the development of GNOME software:
GNOME Builder is the new integrated development environment, Anjuta is the older
one. Glade Interface Designer software constructs graphical interfaces using the graphical
control elements in GTK+. Devhelp is an API browser, Accerciser an accessibility explorer.
There are several debugging tools, including Nemiver, GtkInspector and Alleyoop, have
also been provided to facilitate development of GNOME software.Integration options for third-party development tools (e.g. NoFlo) also exist.
The libsoup library enables access HTTP servers from Gnome applications.</p>

                <p>Xfce is a free and open-source desktop environment for Unix and Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux, Solaris, and BSD.
Xfce aims to be fast and lightweight, while still being visually appealing and easy to use. Xfce embodies the traditional UNIX philosophy of modularity and re-usability. It consists of separately packaged parts that together provide all functions of the desktop environment, but can be selected in subsets to suit user needs and preference. Another priority of Xfce is adherence to standards, specifically those defined at <a href="freedesktop.org"></a>.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Olivier Fourdan started the project in 1996 as a Linux version of the Common Desktop
Environment (CDE), a Unix desktop environment that was initially proprietary and later
released as free software.]However, over time, Xfce diverged from CDE and now stands on
its own. The name "XFCE" was originally an acronym for "XForms Common Environment",
but since that time it has been rewritten twice and no longer uses the XForms toolkit. The
name survived, but it is no longer capitalized as "XFCE", but rather as "Xfce". The
developers' current stance is that the initialism no longer stands for anything specific. After
noting this, the FAQ on the Xfce Wiki comments "(suggestion: X Freakin' Cool
Environment)". The Slackware Linux distribution has nicknamed Xfce the "Cholesterol Free
Desktop Environment", a loose interpretation of the initialism.
Per the FAQ, the logo of Xfce is "a mouse, obviously, for all kinds of reasons like world
domination and monsters and such"[10] (a possible reference to the Maus graphic novel).
In the SuperTuxKart game, in which various open source mascots race against each other,
the mouse is said to be a female named "Xue".
Xfce began as a simple project created with XForms. Olivier Fourdan released the
program, which was just a simple taskbar, on SunSITE.
Fourdan continued developing the project and in 1998, Xfce 2 was released with the first
version of Xfce's window manager, Xfwm. He requested to have the project included in Red
Hat Linux, but was refused due to its XForms basis. Red Hat only accepted software that
was open source and released under either a GPL or BSD compatible license, whereas, at
the time, XForms was closed source and free only for personal use. For the same reason,
Xfce was not in Debian before version 3, and Xfce 2 was only distributed in Debian's
contrib repository.
In March 1999, Fourdan began a complete rewrite of the project based on GTK+, a non-
proprietary toolkit then rising in popularity. The result was Xfce 3.0, licensed under the
GPL. Along with being based completely on free software, the project gained GTK+ drag-
and-drop support, native language support, and improved configurability. Xfce was
uploaded to SourceForge.net in February 2001, starting with version 3.8.1.</p>

                <h2>Xubuntu</h2>
                <p>Xubuntu is a Canonical Ltd.–recognized, community-maintained derivative of
the Ubuntu operating system. The name Xubuntuis a portmanteau of Xfce and Ubuntu, as
it uses the Xfce desktop environment, instead of Ubuntu's Unity.</p>
                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Xubuntu was originally intended to be released at the same time as Ubuntu 5.10 Breezy
Badger, 13 October 2005, but the work was not complete by that date. Instead the Xubuntu
name was used for the xubuntu-desktop metapackage available through the Synaptic
Package Manager which installed the Xfce desktop.
The first official Xubuntu release, led by Jani Monoses, appeared on 1 June 2006, as part
of the Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper Drake line, which also included Kubuntu and Edubuntu.
Cody A.W. Somerville developed a comprehensive strategy for the Xubuntu project named
the Xubuntu Strategy Document. In early 2009 the document was awaiting a second
reading by the Ubuntu Community Council.
In February 2009 Mark Shuttleworth agreed that an official LXDE version of
Ubuntu, Lubuntu, would be developed. The LXDE desktop uses the Openbox window
manager and, like Xubuntu, is intended to be a low-system-requirement, low-RAM
environment for netbooks, mobile devices and older PCs and will compete with Xubuntu in
that niche.
In November 2009, Cody A.W. Somerville stepped down as the project leader and made a
call for nominations to help find a successor. Lionel Le Folgoc was confirmed by the
Xubuntu community as the new project leader on 10 January 2010 and requested the
formation of an official Xubuntu council. As of late March 2010, discussions regarding the
future of Xubuntu's governance and the role a council might play in it were still ongoing.
In March 2012 Charlie Kravetz, a former Xubuntu project leader, formally resigned from the
project. Despite this, the project members indicated that Xubuntu 12.04 would go ahead as
scheduled.
In the beginning of 2016, the Xubuntu team began the process to transition the project to
become council run rather than having a single project leader. On January 1, 2017, an
official post on the Xubuntu site's blog announced the official formation of the Xubuntu
Council. The purpose of the council is not just to make decisions about the future of the
project, but to make sure the direction of the project adheres to guidelines established in
the Strategy Document</p>

                <p>Aqua is the graphical user interface (GUI) and visual theme of Apple's macOS operating
system. It was originally based around the theme of water, with droplet-like components
and a liberal use of reflection effects and translucency. Its goal is to "incorporate color,
depth, translucence, and complex textures into a visually appealing interface" in macOS
applications. At its introduction, Steve Jobs noted that "one of the design goals was when
you saw it you wanted to lick it".
Aqua was first introduced at the 2000 Macworld Conference & Expo in San Francisco. Its
first appearance in a commercial product was in the July 2000 release of iMovie 2, followed
by Mac OS X 10.0 the year after.Aqua is the successor to Platinum, which was used in Mac
OS 8, Mac OS 9and Mac OS X Server 1.2. The appearance of Aqua has changed
frequently over the years, most recently with the release of OS X Yosemite in 2014 which
introduced a flatter look and did away with the gel-like controls and metal-like components.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <h3>Mac OS X 10.2, Panther and Tiger</h3>
                <p>Mac OS X 10.2 "Jaguar" brought flatter interface elements, such as new buttons and drop-
down menus, as well as reducing the transparency to tone down the pinstripes in windows
and menus. These trends continued in subsequent Mac OS X releases.
In Mac OS X Panther, brushed metal was brought to the Finder. New buttons were made to
appear sunken into their surroundings, following a general trend of more flattened interface
elements in the operating system. The traditional pinstripes were replaced with a much
subtler theme, most notably in the menu bar, and the use of transparency was again
reduced (for example in the title bars of inactive windows). Tabs also changed; they were
made flatter and the whole tab area was sunken rather than raised. Tab buttons were
centered on the top border of the tab area. New icons appeared across the system,
including a new flatter, glossier Finder icon and a new System Preferences icon.
Mac OS X Tiger brought more subtle changes, including the unified titlebar
scheme. Pinstripes were removed from the menu bar entirely and replaced with a glossy,
white look. Tabs were altered to appear as normal segmented buttons. The Apple menu
icon was toned down to a more matte appearance and the new Spotlight search utility was
permanently bound to the very right of the menu bar in the same color and gradient of the
Apple menu.</p>
                <h3>Mac OS X Leopard and Snow Leopard</h3>
                <p>Mac OS X Leopard brought wide-ranging changes to Aqua. Aqua windows and "brushed
metal" windows obtained the same metal-like, gray look, pin-striped backgrounds were
removed entirely, toolbars and titlebars were fused into a whole, differences between active
and inactive windows became more distinct through thicker drop shadows and a
monochrome appearance of inactive windows, the color of the menubar was changed into
gray with an optional semi-transparency look on capable Macs and the Dock obtained a 3D
look with a reflective glass-like 'floor'. The Dock's design, when placed on the left or right
side, changed to a black translucent background with a white border and rounded
corners. Context menus had slightly-rounded corners and numerous icons were
redesigned, including folder icons and System Preferences icons.Mac OS X Snow Leopard made almost no changes to Aqua. Most notably, the context
menu of Dock items changed from a solid white to a translucent black.
Mac OS X Lion, OS X Mountain Lion and Mavericks
Mac OS X Lion introduced many changes inspired by iOS that persisted in OS X Mavericks
as well as OS X Yosemite, although the latter changed the overall aesthetic. Scrollbars
were removed and scrollbar handles turned into thin, semi-transparent bars that disappear
when not used. The corner radii of push buttons were reduced, giving an appearance
similar to Mac OS 8 and 9. The gel-like appearance of most components was replaced with
a slightly glossy and flatter look. Window backgrounds became slightly brighter and window
corners were rounded. Lion also added more animations.
OS X Mountain Lion brought only minor changes and changed the Dock's appearance into
a frosted-glass style, with rounded corners, rectangular indicator lights, a new diagonal
separator and a new Trash icon.
OS X Mavericks dispensed with several rich and ornamental designs, reflecting the design
overhaul in iOS 7. The applications Calendar, Contacts and Notes respectively lost their
leather, book and notepad appearance (all introduced in Lion). Linen textures in Notification
Center and Launchpad were removed as well and replaced with simple gray backgrounds.</p>
                <h3>OS X Yosemite and El Capitan</h3>
                <p>In OS X Yosemite, many of the Aqua elements and icons were simplified and flattened,
following a similar design change in iOS 7. Apple incorporated the same saturated frosted-
glass effect, called "Vibrancy", across the system. Examples include: the Dock, the
menubar, sidebars, Notification Center and Mission Control. A similar effect was applied to
toolbars, but they maintained their gray appearance. Toolbar buttons became white and
Apple introduced a compacter type of toolbar that removed the window title, but retained
the toolbar buttons (for example, Safari). Certain controls, such as checkboxes and radio
buttons, gained animations, whereas animations in other places were removed, such as the
"poof" animation when removing an icon from the Dock and the "cube" animation when
fast-switching to another user account. Apple changed the system typeface into Helvetica
Neue. Yosemite also added a 'dark theme' you can turn on in the settings which makes the
dock and toolbar black
OS X El Capitan made only minor changes to Aqua. The white toolbar buttons regained a
slightly glossy look, the spinning pinwheel was redesigned, and the Vibrancy effect was
reduced in certain areas, such as Mission Control. The system typeface was changed once
more, into Apple's own San Francisco typeface, concurrent with iOS 9 and following the
typeface's release in watchOS in April 2015.</p>

                <h2>Interface</h2>
                <p>Historically, Aqua had two window designs: the default Aqua windows and "brushed metal"
windows. Aqua windows typically have a metal-like or gray titlebar with three buttons on the
left side (for closing, minimizing and zooming or entering fullscreen mode). Visually, these
buttons used to be placed on top, but later appeared 'sunken' into the window. Aqua
windows have almost no frame or outside border, instead drop shadows are used to
separate and distinguish active from inactive windows. The aesthetic of the window
backgrounds changed from pin-striped to white backgrounds. Brushed-metal windows had
a thick frame with a metallic texture or dark-gray background and sunken buttons and inner
frames. They had the additional property of being draggable at every point of the frame
instead of just the titlebar and toolbar. Apple recommended brushed-metal windows for
applications that mimic real-world devices (such as iTunes ) or are used to interface with
such devices (such as iSync ),[16] but was criticised by designers for not following its own
guidelines or applying it inconsistently (it was also used in Safari or Finder).[17] Brushed-
metal windows have been largely phased out since Leopard and become visually
indistinctive from Aqua windows.[8]
In addition to titlebars, windows can also have toolbars with separate buttons. Up to
Leopard, toolbars were visually separated from the titlebar and had the same background
as the window frame or were pin-striped.[7] Leopard introduced a unified style that
extended the metal-like background of the titlebar to the toolbar, making it appear as one
whole.[8] Optionally, a separator could be placed between the titlebar and the toolbar to
mimic the previous style. OS X Yosemite brought a compacter version of the toolbar that
fused the titlebar and toolbar together, made it shorter and removed the window title (for
example, in Safari 8 and later).[13]
Drawers are accessory sidebar views that can slide out from any edge of a window except
the top edge. They can be resized perpendicular to their window edge but follow the
window's size in the other direction. Drawers were once frequently used to display controls
and information that did not need to be always visible, but Apple now recommends against
their use.[18]
Sheets are dialog boxes that are modal to a specific window. When opened, they are
thrust towards the user like a sheet of paper, hence the name. They are partially
transparent and focus attention on the content of the sheet. The parent window's controls
are disabled until the sheet is dismissed, but the user is able to continue work in other
windows (including those in the same application) while the sheet is open.</p>

The appearance of the KDE software is configurable in several levels. Both the manager of

interchangeable, that define every aspect of your appearance. It is for this reason that the
KDE environment does not maintain a unique appearance between versions, but instead opts for
that most widely accepted at the time of each new release.
The KDE desktop environment does not behave in a predefined way, but allows
the user adapt the system to your taste and comfort. This does not prevent the same

Plasma 5.0 improves support for HiDPI displays and ships a converged graphical shell,

default theme, dubbed Breeze. Changes under the hood include the migration to a new,
fully hardware-accelerated graphics stack centered on an OpenGL(ES)-based scene graph
(canvas). Plasma 5 completes the migration of KDE Plasma 4 to QtQuick. Qt 5's QtQuick 2
uses a hardware-accelerated OpenGL(ES) scenegraph to compose and render graphics on
the screen, which allows for the offloading of computationally expensive graphics rendering
tasks onto the GPU, which frees up resources on the system's main CPU, and is faster and
more power efficient.</p>

                <h2>Kubuntu</h2>
                <p>Kubuntu is an official flavour of the Ubuntu operating system which uses the KDE Plasma
Desktop instead of the Unitygraphical environment. As part of the Ubuntu project, Kubuntu
uses the same underlying systems. Every package in Kubuntu shares the same
repositories as Ubuntu, and it is released regularly on the same schedule as Ubuntu.
Kubuntu was sponsored by Canonical Ltd. until 2012, and then directly by Blue Systems.
Now employees of Blue Systems contribute upstream, to KDE and Debian, and Kubuntu
development is led by community contributors. During the changeover, Kubuntu retained
the use of Ubuntu project servers and existing developers.
Kubuntu's Plasma Desktop is fully customizable without extra tools or configuration file
editing. Originally designed to ease transition for users from other operating systems (such
as Microsoft Windows) by allowing a similar desktop layout, the KDE Plasma Desktop
incorporates widget-centric modularity that allows the user to incorporate function similar to
all other operating systems and also create new functionality not found in other operating
system desktops. Desktop effects are integrated in the standard KWin installation, and
enabled by default.
Because Ubuntu and Kubuntu use the same sources, any application intended for one is
installable and runnable on the other. Consequently, it is very common to see situations

                <p>The birth date of Kubuntu was the 10th December 2004 at the Ubuntu Mataro Conference
in Mataró, Spain.Canonical employee Andreas Mueller, from Gnoppix, had the idea to
make a Ubuntu KDE deviate and got the allowance from Mark Shuttleworth to start the first
Ubuntu deviate, called Kubuntu. On the same evening Chris Halls from the Openoffice
project and Jonathan Riddell from KDE started volunteering to the newborn Project.
The Kubuntu team released the first edition, Hoary Hedgehog, on April 8, 2005.
K Desktop Environment 3 was used as default interface until Kubuntu 8.04. That version
included KDE Plasma Desktop as unsupported option which became default in the
subsequent release, 8.10.
On February 6, 2012, Canonical employee Jonathan Riddell announced the end of
Canonical's Kubuntu sponsorship. On April 10, 2012, Blue Systems was announced on the
Kubuntu website as new sponsor. As a result, both developers employed by Canonical to
work on Kubuntu – Jonathan Riddell and Aurélien Gâteau – transferred to Blue Systems.</p>

Comparing Linux distribution rankings for DistroWatch in early January 2011 for the year

Looking through the tables, an interesting thing is the rise of distributions that use the
lightweight, but full-featured LXDE desktop or the Openbox window manager. As an
example, Lubuntu now comfortably beats Kubuntu in terms of page hits, while CrunchBang
Linux, a lightweight distribution with Openbox is still in the top 25 even though it failed to
produce a stable release for well over a year. Many other distributions started offering
LXDE-based editions of their products, further contributing to the dramatic rise in popularity
of this relatively new desktop environment.</p>

                <h2>Lubuntu</h2>
                <p>Lubuntu is a lightweight Linux distribution based on Ubuntu but using the LXDE desktop
environment in place of Ubuntu's Unity shell and GNOME desktop. LXDE is touted as being
"lighter, less resource hungry and more energy-efficient".
Like Xubuntu, Lubuntu is intended to be a low-system-requirement, low-RAM environment
for netbooks, mobile devices, and older PCs. Tests show it can use half as much RAM as
Xubuntu, making it an attractive choice for installing on older hardware such as being
refurbished for charitable distribution.
The name Lubuntu is a portmanteau of LXDE and Ubuntu. LXDE stands for Lightweight
X11 Desktop Environment, while the word Ubuntu means "humanity towards others" in
the Zulu and Xhosa languages.
Lubuntu received official recognition as a formal member of the Ubuntu family on 11 May
2011, commencing with Lubuntu 11.10, which was released on 13 October 2011.
The LXDE desktop was first made available for Ubuntu in October 2008, with the release
of Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid Ibex. These early versions of Lubuntu, including 8.10, 9.04 and
9.10, were not available as separate ISO image downloads, and could only be installed on
Ubuntu as separate lubuntu-desktop packages from the Ubuntu repositories. LXDE can
also be retroactively installed in earlier Ubuntu versions.</p>

                <p>Unity is a graphical shell for the GNOME desktop environment originally developed
by Canonical Ltd. for its Ubuntu operating system. Unity debuted in the netbook
edition of Ubuntu 10.10. It was initially designed to make more efficient use of space given
the limited screen size of netbooks, including, for example, a vertical application switcher
called the launcher, and a space-saving horizontal multipurpose top menu bar.
Unlike GNOME, KDE Software Compilation, Xfce, or LXDE, Unity is not a collection of
applications but is designed to use existing programs.
Unity is part of the Ayatana project, an initiative with the stated intention of improving the
user experience within Ubuntu. In addition to Unity, there are Application Indicators and
other projects such as MeMenu, the notification system and the application NotifyOSD
gathered.
On 5 April 2017 Mark Shuttleworth announced that Canonical's work on Unity will end and
that Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, a year away from release at the time, will abandon the Unity
desktop and employ the GNOME 3 desktop instead, as Canonical moves away from its
ambitions to produce a unified cell phone and desktop operating system and concentrates
on desktop, cloud computing and Internet of things platforms instead. UBports founder
Marius Gripsgård announced that the organization would continue Unity development.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>In May 2010, Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Canonical Limited, creator of Ubuntu,
announced Unity, a user interface for the Ubuntu desktop.
The Unity interface was initially created due to the differences that arose with the
design and user experience offered by the GNOME Shell desktop, but Unity
it is also a shell or interface created for the GNOME desktop environment, therefore,
both meet the same objective, but have a different philosophy of use.
After the release of Ubuntu Netbook Edition 10.10, it was found that a
graphical hardware (GPU) with good performance to be able to run Unity, and this fact
caused criticism from users who owned desktop computers
low. One of the causes of the high demand in graphic hardware would be the manager of
Mutter windows, which turned out to be very slow on low-end equipment. East
problem would be solved quickly in the next Ubuntu release, with the
incorporation of Compiz, thanks to its extensive development and support in different types of
hardware, providing a remarkable improvement in speed in its early stages of
incorporation to the development of Unity.
In April 2011, the use of Unity in the Ubuntu version was announced.
desk, 7 due to the fusion of the netbook version with the desktop version.
In October 2011, the elements of the Unity interface were passed to GTK3 and it was
presented the Unity 2D interface, which provided the interface already known then, but
oriented to low-end computers, and written using the Qt library. In addition to
share code and interface, it was used as an option in the Ubuntu session login
11.10.
In January 2012, it was announced that Unity 2D will be used in Ubuntu TV, which was
presented during the CES technology fair.
As of October 2012, at the release of Ubuntu 12.10, development was abandoned
of Unity 2D and Canonical concentrated all the development only on the Unity 3D interface, which
uses the Nux and OpenGL ES interface toolset because the manager of
Compiz windows will be ported to this. With this the Ubuntu TV interface would be passed to
Unity 3D and there would only be one environment for Ubuntu, but with new drivers for
low-end computers.
In March 2013, his successor, Unity Next, was announced, unlike his predecessor who
uses Compiz and Nux. To exist as an interface in Ubuntu, Unity Next was built
purely in the QML language and the Qt library, making direct use of the
OpenGL specification and its availability was expected for all devices with
Ubuntu (desktop, phone, tablet computers and TVs) in April 2014.12
But the project for the Ubuntu Edge smartphone, which would have such interface, does not
got enough funding. The arrival of Unity Mir and Unity 8 was expected as
desktop interfaces for Ubuntu but the plans were postponed. Finally, on 5
April 2017, Mark Shuttleworth publicly announced that Canonical, based on
decisions of the IT market, concluded its investments in Unity, dedicating them to
areas that contribute to the development of that company such as the operating system
Ubuntu, the products of computing in the cloud and the Internet of things. The desk
Unity will disappear from the future version of Ubuntu 18.04 that will be presented in April
2018, being replaced by GNOME.</p>

                <p>Cinnamon is a desktop environment based on GNOME 3. It was started in 2011. Cinnamon
originally started as a fork of GNOME Shell, thus initially as a mere graphical shell of the
GNOME software, but became its own desktop environment in Cinnamon 2.0. Cinnamon
was developed by the Linux Mint distribution, with wider adoption spreading to other Linux
distributions over time.
Because the Cinnamon desktop environment intends to implement a graphical user
interface (GUI) distinct from the GNOME desktop environment, many of the GNOME Core
Applications were forked, so that their GUIs could be rewritten appropriately.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The Linux Mint development team was initially unsure about the future of the distribution
after the release of GNOME 3. Its new graphical shell, GNOME Shell, did not fit the design
goals the team had in mind for Linux Mint, but there were initially no available alternatives.
Linux Mint 11 "Katya" was released in May 2011 with the final release of GNOME 2, but it
was clear that a better solution was needed, as GNOME Panel was no longer being
developed Therefore, the team set out to improve GNOME Shell so that it would fit Linux
Mint's goals, and the result was the "Mint GNOME Shell Extensions" (MGSE). In the
meantime, the MATE desktop environment was forked from GNOME 2. The Mint team
decided to incorporate MATE into Linux Mint 12 "Lisa" alongside MGSE, to give users a
choice whether to use the traditional GNOME 2 desktop or the GNOME 3-based MGSE.
However, MGSE fell short of expectations. Since GNOME Shell was going in a different
direction than the Mint developers had in mind, it was clear that MGSE was not viable in
the long run. In response to this problem, GNOME Shell was forked to create the
Cinnamon project, allowing the Linux Mint developers better control over the development
process and to implement their own vision of the GNOME interface for use in future
releases of Linux Mint. The project was publicly announced on 2 January 2012 on the Linux
Mint blog.
From version 1.2 onward, Cinnamon uses Muffin, a fork of Mutter from GNOME 3, as its
window manager.
Cinnamon 1.6 was introduced on 18 September 2012 with new default file
browser Nemo replacing Nautilus, although Nautilus is still optional.
Cinnamon 1.8 was released on 5 May 2013. GNOME Control Center has been forked. It is
now called Cinnamon-Control-Center and it combines Gnome-Control-Center and
Cinnamon-Settings. Gnome-Screensaver has been also forked and is now called
Cinnamon-Screensaver. Now it is possible to install and update applets, extensions,
desklets and themes through control-center instead of placing example themes into the
themes folder. It also features a modified Nemo interface. Desklets that come with the
release are like Widgets.
Cinnamon 2.0 was released on 10 October 2013. From this version, Cinnamon is no longer
a frontend on top of the GNOME desktop like Unity or GNOME Shell, but "an entire desktop
environment". Cinnamon is still built on GNOME technologies and uses GTK+, but it no
longer requires GNOME itself to be installed. The biggest changes in this release are
improved edge-tiling, improved user management, configurable individual sound effects
and performance improvements for full screen applications.Cinnamon 3.2 was tagged on 7 November 2016 and released to the first Mint environment
LMDE2 on 13 November 2016. The biggest changes in this release are changes to the
appearance of the menu system, a revised screensaver, changes to the selection of input
methods, the ability to have panels at the sides of the screen, improvements in background
transitions, changes to the handling of applet settings, and changes to use
the libinput library which in turn brings facilities like accelerometer based screen rotation</p>

                <p>Windows Vista (codenamed Longhorn) is an operating system by Microsoft for use on
personal computers, including home and business desktops, laptops, tablet PCs and media
center PCs. Development was completed on 8 November 2006, and over the following
three months, it was released in stages to computer hardware and software manufacturers,
business customers and retail channels. On 30 January 2007, it was released
worldwide and was made available for purchase and download from the Windows
Marketplace. The release of Windows Vista came more than five years after the
introduction of its predecessor, Windows XP, the longest time span between successive
releases of Microsoft Windows desktop operating systems. It was succeeded by Windows
7, which was released to manufacturing on 22 July 2009 and released worldwide for retail
on 22 October 2009.</p>
              </section>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Microsoft began work on Windows Vista, known at the time by its codename Longhorn, in
May 2001,five months before the release of Windows XP. It was originally expected to ship
sometime late in 2003 as a minor step between Windows XP and Blackcomb, which was
planned to be the company's next major operating system release. Gradually, "Longhorn"
assimilated many of the important new features and technologies slated for Blackcomb,
resulting in the release date being pushed back several times in 3 years. In some builds of
Longhorn, their license agreement said "For the Microsoft product codenamed "Whistler"".
Many of Microsoft's developers were also re-tasked to build updates to Windows
XP and Windows Server 2003 to strengthen security. Faced with ongoing delays and
concerns about feature creep, Microsoft announced on 27 August 2004, that it had revised
its plans. For this reason, Longhorn was reset to start work on componentizing the
Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 codebase, and over time re-incorporating the
features that would be intended for an actual operating system release. However, some
previously announced features such as WinFS were dropped or postponed, and a new
software development methodology called the Security Development Lifecycle was
incorporated in an effort to address concerns with the security of the Windows codebase,
which is programmed in C, C++ and assembly. Longhorn became known as Vista in 2005.
The early development stages of Longhorn were generally characterized by incremental
improvements and updates to Windows XP. During this period, Microsoft was fairly quiet
about what was being worked on, as their marketing and public relations focus was more
strongly focused on Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, which was released in April
2003. Occasional builds of Longhorn were leaked onto popular file sharing networks such
as IRC, BitTorrent, eDonkey and various newsgroups, and so most of what is known about
builds prior to the first sanctioned development release of Longhorn in May 2003, is derived
from these builds.
After several months of relatively little news or activity from Microsoft with Longhorn,
Microsoft released Build 4008, which had made an appearance on the Internet around 28
February 2003. It was also privately handed out to a select group of software developers.
As an evolutionary release over build 3683, it contained a number of small improvements,
including a modified blue "Plex" theme and a new, simplified Windows Image-based
installer that operates in graphical mode from the outset, and completed an install of the
operating system in approximately one third the time of Windows XP on the samehardware. An optional "new taskbar" was introduced that was thinner than the previous
build and displayed the time differently.
The most notable visual and functional difference, however, came with Windows Explorer.
The incorporation of the Plex theme made blue the dominant color of the entire application.
The Windows XP-style task pane was almost completely replaced with a large horizontal
pane that appeared under the toolbars. A new search interface allowed for filtering of
results, searching of Windows help, and natural-language queries that would be used to
integrate with WinFS. The animated search characters were also removed. The "view
modes" were also replaced with a single slider that would resize the icons in real-time, in
list, thumbnail, or details mode, depending on where the slider was. File metadata was also
made more visible and more easily editable, with more active encouragement to fill out
missing pieces of information. Also of note was the conversion of Windows Explorer to
being a .NET application.
Most builds of Longhorn and Vista were identified by a label that was always displayed in
the bottom-right corner of the desktop. A typical build label would look like "Longhorn Build
3663.Lab06_N.020728-1728". Higher build numbers did not automatically mean that the
latest features from every development team at Microsoft was included. Typically, a team
working on a certain feature or subsystem would generate their own working builds which
developers would test with, and when the code was deemed stable, all the changes would
be incorporated back into the main development tree at once. At Microsoft, a number of
"Build labs" exist where the compilation of the entirety of Windows can be performed by a
team. The name of the lab in which any given build originated is shown as part of the build
label, and the date and time of the build follows that. Some builds (such as Beta 1 and Beta
2) only display the build label in the version information dialog (Winver). The icons used in
these builds are from Windows XP.
At the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference (WinHEC) in May 2003, Microsoft gave
their first public demonstrations of the new Desktop Window Manager and Aero. The
demonstrations were done on a revised build 4015 which was never released. A number of
sessions for developers and hardware engineers at the conference focused on these new
features, as well as the Next-Generation Secure Computing Base (previously known as
"Palladium"), which at the time was Microsoft's proposed solution for creating a secure
computing environment whereby any given component of the system could be deemed
"trusted". Also at this conference, Microsoft reiterated their roadmap for delivering
Longhorn, pointing to an "early 2005" release date.</p>

                <p>Vista includes technologies such as ReadyBoost and ReadyDrive, which employ fast flash
memory (located on USB flash drives and hybrid hard disk drives) to improve system
performance by caching commonly used programs and data. This manifests itself in
improved battery life on notebook computers as well, since a hybrid drive can be spun
down when not in use. Another new technology called SuperFetch utilizes machine
learning techniques to analyze usage patterns to allow Windows Vista to make intelligent
decisions about what content should be present in system memory at any given time. It
uses almost all the extra RAM as disk cache. In conjunction with SuperFetch, an automatic
built-in Windows Disk Defragmenter makes sure that those applications are strategically
positioned on the hard disk where they can be loaded into memory very quickly with the
least amount of physical movement of the hard disk's read-write heads.
As part of the redesign of the networking architecture, IPv6 has been fully incorporated into
the operating system and a number of performance improvements have been introduced,
such as TCP window scaling. Earlier versions of Windows typically needed third-party
wireless networking software to work properly, but this is not the case with Vista, which
includes more comprehensive wireless networking support.For graphics, Vista introduces a new Windows Display Driver Model and a major revision
to Direct3D. The new driver model facilitates the new Desktop Window Manager, which
provides the tearing-free desktop and special effects that are the cornerstones of Windows
Aero. Direct3D 10, developed in conjunction with major graphics card manufacturers, is a
new architecture with more advanced shadersupport, and allows the graphics processing
unit to render more complex scenes without assistance from the CPU. It features improved
load balancing between CPU and GPU and also optimizes data transfer between
them. WDDM also provides video content playback that rivals typical consumer electronics
devices. It does this by making it easy to connect to external monitors, providing for
protected HD video playback and increasing overall video playback quality. For the first
time in Windows, graphics processing unit (GPU) multitasking is possible, enabling users to
run more than one GPU-intensive application simultaneously.
At the core of the operating system, many improvements have been made to the memory
manager, process scheduler and I/O scheduler. The Heap Manager implements additional
features such as integrity checking in order to improve robustness and defend
against buffer overflow security exploits, although this comes at the price of breaking
backward compatibility with some legacy applications. A Kernel Transaction Manager has
been implemented that enables applications to work with the file
system and Registry using atomic transaction operations.</p>

shapes. Early examples of Metro principles can be found in Encarta 95 and MSN 2.0. The
design language evolved in Windows Media Center and Zune and was formally introduced
as "Metro" during the unveiling of Windows Phone 7. It has since been incorporated into
several of the company's other products, including the Xbox 360 system software, Xbox
One, Windows 8, Windows Phone, and Outlook.com. Before the "Microsoft design
language" title became official, Microsoft representative Qi Lu referred to it as the modern
UI design language in his MIXX conference keynote speech. According to Microsoft,
"Metro" has always been a codename and was never meant as a final product, but news
websites attribute this change to trademark issues.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The design language is based on the design principles of classic Swiss graphic design.
Early glimpses of this style could be seen in Windows Media Center for Windows XP Media
Center Edition, which favored text as the primary form of navigation. This interface carried
over into later iterations of Media Center. In 2006, Zune refreshed its interface using these
principles. Microsoft designers decided to redesign the interface and with more focus on
clean typography and less on UI chrome. These principles and the new Zune UI were
carried over to Windows Phone (from which much was drawn for Windows 8). The Zune
Desktop Client was also redesigned with an emphasis on typography and clean design that
was different from the Zune's previous Portable Media Center based UI. Flat colored "live
tiles" were introduced into the design language during the early Windows Phone's studies.
Microsoft Design Language 2 (MDL2) was developed alongside Windows 10. This version
introduced a new set of widgets, including date pickers, toggles and switches, and reduced
the border thicknesses for all user interface elements.</p>
                <h3>Reception</h3>
                <h4>Before Windows 8</h4>
                <p>Early response to the language was generally positive. In a review of the Zune
HD, Engadget said, "Microsoft continues its push towards big, big typography here,
providing a sophisticated, neatly designed layout that's almost as functional as it is
attractive." CNET complimented the design language, saying, "it's a bit more daring and
informal than the tight, sterile icon grids and Rolodex menus of the iPhone and iPod
Touch."
At its IDEA 2011 Ceremony, the Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA) gave
Windows Phone 7, which uses the UI, its "Gold Interactive" award, its "People's Choice
Award", and a "Best in Show" award.Isabel Ancona, the User Experience Consultant at
IDSA, explained why Windows Phone won:
The innovation here is the fluidity of experience and focus on the data, without using
traditional user interface conventions of windows and frames. Data becomes the visual
elements and controls. Simple gestures and transitions guide the user deeper into content.
A truly elegant and unique experience.
Criticism particularly focused on the use of all caps text. With the rise of Internet usage,
critics have compared this to a computer program shouting at its user. IT journalist Lee
Hutchinson described Microsoft's use of the practice in the macOS version of OneNote as
terrible, claiming that it is "cursed with insane, non-standard application window menus IN
ALL CAPS that doesn’t so much violate OS X’s design conventions as it does take them
out behind the shed, pour gasoline on them, and set them on fire."</p>
                <h4>After Windows 8</h4>
                <p>With the arrival of Windows 8, the operating system's user interface and its use of the
design language drew generally negative critical responses. On 25 August 2012, Peter
Bright of Ars Technica reviewed the preview release of Windows 8, dedicating the first part
of the review to a comparison between the Start menu designs used by Windows 8 and
Windows 7. Recounting their pros and cons, Peter Bright concluded that the Start menu in
Windows 8 (dubbed Start screen), though not devoid of problems, was a clear winner.
However, he concluded that Windows 8's user interface was frustrating and that the various
aspects of the user interface did not work well together.Woody Leonhard was even more
critical when he said, "From the user's standpoint, Windows 8 is a failure – an awkward
mishmash that pulls the user in two directions at once."
In addition to the changes to the Start menu, Windows 8 takes a more modal approach with
its use of full-screen apps that steer away from reliance on the icon-based desktop
interface. In doing so, however, Microsoft has shifted its focus away from multitasking and
business productivity.</p>

                <h2>Name change</h2>
                <p>In August 2012, The Verge announced that an internal memorandum had been sent out to
developers and Microsoft employees announcing the decision to "discontinue the use" of
the term "Metro" because of "discussions with an important European partner", and that
they were "working on a replacement term".Technology news outlets Ars
Technica , TechRadar , CNET , Engadget and Network World and mainstream press Bits
Blog from The New York Times Company and the BBC News Online published that the
partner mentioned in the memo could be one of Microsoft's retail partners, German
company Metro AG , as the name had the potential to infringe on their "Metro" trademark.
Microsoft later stated that the reason for de-emphasizing the name was not related to any
current litigation, and that "Metro" was only an internal project codename, despite having
heavily promoted the brand to the public.
In September 2012, "Microsoft design language" was adopted as the official name for the
design style. The term was used on Microsoft Developer Network documentation and at the
2012 Build conference to refer to the design language.
In a related change, Microsoft dropped use of the phrase "Metro-style apps" to refer
to mobile apps distributed via Windows Store.</p>
